- the app is used by staff members only
  
  This means that there is no need for a student/staff-specific functionality
  separation by the problem specification. The app is not intended for students.

- the user can register a specific student for a specific course (course event)
  
  There needs to be a way to select a course and a student to create
  a registration. One idea would be having a 'register' function accessible via
  'course info' screen; the mechanism could be analogous to that of
  adding/removing professors at course events.

- the user can change the description of a course

  This would be part of a course info screen where you can see all data fields
  and change some of them. The course info screen might pull together data from
  'courses' and from 'course_events' and 'course_units' tables to present both
  the static info not dependent on semesters, and a list of valid course runs

- the user can add/remove professors assigned to a course event/course run

  In the course info tab with its list of course events, those events could be
  clickable, and by clicking you would be presented with the info associated
  with the selected course run (without changing the view, just filling in
  fields). Then, you could change some things, like the list of professors or
  the registration deadline date.

- the user can register a grade for a student in a course

- the user can get a 'semester report' (for a student? a course event?)
